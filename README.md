# ScrollViews
An Extended Version of FullPage.js by Alvaro Trigo http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/

ScrollViews adds features to support "subviews" within the context of FullPage.js sections. Users can navigate between these subviews using browser scrolling (the best understood browser navigation method), but they use their own (non-scrolling) transitions.


## Fork Base
This project was based on a fork of FullPage.js v2.9.5
